**Brief introduction:**
This package provides functions for calculating associations between two genes with five correlation methods(e.g., the Gini correlation coefficient [GCC], the Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient [PCC], the Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient [KCC], the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [SCC] and the Tukey's biweight correlation coefficient [BiWt], and three non-correlation methods (e.g., mutual information [MI] and the maximal information-based nonparametric exploration [MINE], and the euclidean distance [ED]). It can also been implemented to perform the correlation and clustering analysis of transcriptomic data profiled by microarray and RNA-Seq technologies. Additionally, this package can be further applied to construct gene co-expression networks (GCNs).</br>
